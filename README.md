# Akira game engine

## Build

Generate project files/build using CMake. I like to make a directory called `build` at the root and then run
```
cmake ..
```
from that directory. This will generate relevant project files.


## Notes
 OpenGL (and GLFW).


to run app call build app from app folder

```
./../build/App/App
```
or

```
./run.sh
```

## Roadmap

- Fix run app folder

- ImGui

- Improve Event System on app layers

- ECS like design
